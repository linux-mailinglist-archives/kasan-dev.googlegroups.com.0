Digital Image Processing: A Pragmatic Approach by Jayaraman, Veerakumar and 
EsakkirajanDigital image processing is the field of study that deals with 
manipulating and analyzing images using various techniques and algorithms. 
It has applications in many domains such as computer vision, medical 
imaging, biometrics, remote sensing, security, entertainment and more.

One of the most popular and comprehensive books on digital image processing 
is Digital Image Processing by S. Jayaraman, T. Veerakumar and S. 
Esakkirajan. This book provides a clear, up-to-date and practical 
introduction to the subject for students and practicing engineers. It 
covers the fundamental concepts and methods of image processing such as 
image representation, enhancement, restoration, segmentation, compression, 
feature extraction, recognition and classification. It also includes 
illustrative examples and MATLAB applications to help readers understand 
and implement the theory in practice.
The book is divided into 12 chapters that cover the following topics:
Chapter 1: Introduction to Digital Image ProcessingChapter 2: Digital Image 
FundamentalsChapter 3: Image Enhancement in Spatial DomainChapter 4: Image 
Enhancement in Frequency DomainChapter 5: Image RestorationChapter 6: Color 
Image ProcessingChapter 7: Image CompressionChapter 8: Morphological Image 
ProcessingChapter 9: Image SegmentationChapter 10: Representation and 
DescriptionChapter 11: Object RecognitionChapter 12: Wavelets and 
Multiresolution ProcessingThe book is published by Tata McGraw Hill 
Education and has received positive reviews from readers and experts. It is 
suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate courses in engineering and 
computer science as well as for self-study and reference.
One of the main features of the book is its illustrative approach, which 
uses numerous figures, tables and diagrams to explain the concepts and 
techniques of image processing. The book also provides several practical 
examples and case studies to demonstrate the applications of image 
processing in various domains such as face recognition, fingerprint 
recognition, iris recognition, license plate recognition, medical image 
analysis, satellite image analysis and more.
Another feature of the book is its MATLAB applications, which are given at 
the end of each chapter. These applications help the readers to implement 
the algorithms and methods discussed in the book using MATLAB, a popular 
software tool for numerical computation and visualization. The MATLAB code 
and images used in the book are also available online for download.


The book is written in a simple and lucid style that makes it easy to read 
and understand. The authors have used a logical and systematic approach to 
present the topics and have avoided unnecessary mathematical details and 
derivations. The book also contains review questions, multiple choice 
questions and exercises at the end of each chapter to test the readers' 
comprehension and reinforce their learning.
