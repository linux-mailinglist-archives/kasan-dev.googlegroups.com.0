If you use the Internet, your home most likely has a router. You have 
plugged that router in and have a basic Wi-Fi network up and running. What 
you might not realize is that your preset network is less than ideal. You 
might not have any password set, or your *Wi-Fi network* is not optimized 
for your use. To make any changes to your Wi-Fi network, you need to login 
to your router using 192.168.10.84. Even if your router was set up by a 
professional, perhaps by the ISP, and you are happy with how things are, 
you might still need to use *192.168.10.84* when something goes wrong. It 
is always handy knowing how to access your routers admin page in case you 
need to change something, and getting to that admin page is not as hard as 
you might think.
Firefox For Mac Os X 10.84

*DOWNLOAD* https://t.co/6L3sLUnfP9


*With your computer device connected to your router*, open your web browser 
of choice. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or Safari are 
some examples of popular browsers. With your browser open, enter your IP 
address, 192.168.10.84, into the search bar. 
- *Searching for 192.168.10.84* will take you to the login section of your 
router admin page. You will need to input the username and password 
associated with your router. The correct details will take you to the menu 
of your router admin page.

Another popular setting people change on their router is the actual local *IP 
address* of your router. Your router has two IP addresses, with more on 
that below. If you opt to change your IP address away from *192.168.10.84*, 
you should take note of your new address as you will need it to access your 
router admin page.

The *192.168.10.84* *IP address* is a local, private, or gateway *IP 
address*. 192.168.10.84 is your router's address that computer devices 
connected to the network will use to send data requests over the internet. 
Your router also has a *public IP addre**ss*. The *public IP address* gets 
used by the ISP and any website you visit, to get the information of the 
website you visit, to your router, with your router the sending that data, 
back to your computer screen, via the *private IP address*.

*192.168.10.84* is a common *private **IP address*, though it might not be 
yours. If 192.168.10.84 is not your *IP address*, you can search for your 
router model online, which should reveal the default IP address of your 
router. The IP address may also be listed in the manual of your router. If 
those methods don't work, you can use your computer to find your *IP 
address*.

The only way your *private IP address* will change is if you change it. If 
your routers IP address does not match *192.168.10.84* or one of the other 
default IP addresses, then someone may have changed it before. If that is 
the case and you wish to reset it back to default, then you can perform a 
factory reset on your router, though that will reset everything else on the 
router.

As touched on above, *192.168.10.84 is a private IP address* that your 
router uses to distinguish itself on the network, and a delivery point for 
data requests from computer devices using the Wi-Fi network. *192.168.10.84 
is not unique to your router* as most router manufacturers use a selection 
of *private IP addresses* across their ranges of routers. With that said, a *private 
IP address* is not even unique to a certain brand. It is done this way, as 
the only person who needs to know the *private IP address* is the owner of 
the router.

But how does your router know which computer device is sending it data 
requests? Well, your router is not the only device on your network, with 
each computer connected to your *Wi-Fi network*, also having a *private IP 
address such as 192.168.10.84*. The string of numbers that is your *IP 
address helps each device communicate* with the other. And it is not just 
internet-capable devices that have an IP address. Printers and storage 
devices also have an IP address, so your router and computer devices using 
the network can connect with them and use them. Usually, the IP addresses 
of other devices on the *Wi-Fi network* are deviations of the router *IP 
address*, with the last number being different.

*192.168.10.84* is a *private IP address* and directly related to your *Wi-Fi 
network*. It is the chain of numbers you use to access the router admin 
page. However, as briefly mentioned, your router also has another *public 
IP address*.
